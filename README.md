# Introduction
The pyFTree is a open source tool that takes a FT model as a python program and spit out minimal cutsets.
To generate a fault tree, use ``FT_parser`` and provide the path of the program file.

**Disclaimer** Its a fun project and in an early stage of the development. The `FTree.py` and `FT_parser.py` expectedly contains bugs that would be uncovered as the project goes to the next stages.

**Contributions**: The suggestions/contributions are welcome and could be pushed in through pull request.
A feature request can also be made by opening issues.
